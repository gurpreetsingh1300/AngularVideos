WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:05.130
Where are you successful let's all get together.

00:06.840 --> 00:13.650
I'll start right bloaters orders list and add a button with some C S S classes button button primary

00:13.980 --> 00:19.410
where I will say display details or maybe you should even say toggle displays.

00:19.420 --> 00:26.080
Now that I think about it but I'll leave it at this then I'll add my paragraph where I say any text

00:26.080 --> 00:31.610
you like here I will stick to secret password equals tuna and I only want to display this.

00:31.690 --> 00:36.070
Well if it is not displayed and if it is displayed I want to not display it.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.820
So really toggling it.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.600
That's super easy to implement.

00:40.650 --> 00:47.290
I'll add a property to my app component which will name show secret any name you like of course and

00:47.280 --> 00:49.820
it will set this to false initially.

00:50.110 --> 00:56.720
And now in my app component I'll add a click listener to my button with event binding.

00:57.070 --> 01:03.490
And here I will simply set shows secret equal to watch shows secret.

01:03.490 --> 01:05.400
Currently it's not.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.640
So that is a quick and easy way of toggling it.

01:08.710 --> 01:10.790
So if it does fall it will be set to true.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.750
If it was true it will be set to False.

01:13.750 --> 01:17.760
Now with that I can add NGF here and check.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.320
It shows secret is true and only show it.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.210
In this case.

01:21.310 --> 01:27.640
Now with this and Engy search still running if you go back and click this now you see the toggling works

01:27.940 --> 01:29.150
as expected.

01:29.170 --> 01:33.430
So the first three tasks are already solved.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.400
Now let's move on to the fourth one.

01:35.410 --> 01:42.760
Logging it to the console for this are actually duplicate the Spartan and coming out the first solution

01:42.820 --> 01:52.960
with the easy toggling because for logging I will call a method now on toggle display maybe or on toggle

01:53.050 --> 01:57.130
displayed on toggle details Excuse me any name you like.

01:57.130 --> 02:00.720
Though I'll add this as a method in the app component.

02:01.180 --> 02:07.150
And first of all I will still use my toggling code here so I will said does show a secret you want to

02:07.210 --> 02:09.060
show secret it's not.

02:09.550 --> 02:10.960
But then I want to log it.

02:10.990 --> 02:14.690
So I'll name this log and it should be an empty array at the beginning.

02:15.010 --> 02:24.030
And then here I will simply say this log push and I want to push a new number and this number should

02:24.030 --> 02:27.440
actually take into account the current length of this.

02:27.450 --> 02:32.600
So if this is at the beginning has zero items this will be zero.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.800
So I'll add plus one.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.260
So if you have one element in the array the Lanc will be 1.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.490
So the next element should have a value of 2.

02:41.970 --> 02:44.590
So this adds these items to the log.

02:44.940 --> 02:50.190
Now I would output it below to a paragraph and I would choose a div element here.

02:50.190 --> 02:52.130
I will use energy for on it.

02:52.320 --> 03:00.550
And we learned that we use energy for by saying Let And now we could say log item any name you like

03:01.090 --> 03:01.990
of law.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.990
So off the property you want to loop through.

03:04.090 --> 03:09.200
Generally the data piece you want to loop through that could also be a method called returning an array.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.440
It has to be an array though.

03:11.590 --> 03:19.180
So here we lock we loop through the log and between the day of opening and closing Pentax I can now

03:19.180 --> 03:25.450
use stringin tribulation to output by log item that we did do it in the last lectures but it told you

03:25.450 --> 03:27.550
that last item is a variable.

03:27.550 --> 03:31.180
We can now use a template and that's exactly what we're doing here.

03:31.180 --> 03:33.120
I'm outputting a log item.

03:33.520 --> 03:40.660
So with this if we have a look at our application and I click this button you'll see that I add this

03:40.660 --> 03:41.200
list.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.520
It's jumping around because I'm adding and removing this secret password.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.640
But you see the list is growing as expected.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.330
The log is working.

03:50.740 --> 03:53.030
Now about that coloring.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.800
The fifth step here.

03:55.030 --> 04:00.020
Well it's easy to do when using a number like this when doing so.

04:00.070 --> 04:04.880
I'll go to my death and I will start with the style the black blue background.

04:05.050 --> 04:10.360
So we'll use energy style and we learned we need property binding for this to work correctly because

04:10.360 --> 04:16.880
we need to pass a javascript object configuring our styles when we want to attach which styles.

04:17.230 --> 04:20.310
So the Starla want to attach this to background color.

04:20.530 --> 04:26.380
I'll again use camel case notation though you could use single quotation marks to have background dash

04:26.500 --> 04:28.630
color as a name.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.620
And now here it's easy to check if a log item is a number.

04:32.650 --> 04:39.160
Because I want to check and LAT a log item is greater or equal than 5 in which case background color

04:39.160 --> 04:40.350
should be blue.

04:40.360 --> 04:47.200
This is a string overwise it will be transparent or white to basically have a non blue background to

04:47.200 --> 04:51.680
your log item of course is numbers so this check should be easy.

04:51.760 --> 04:56.240
And yes you could outsource this part of course into a method you call here.

04:56.380 --> 05:03.010
Generally having most of the logic in the typescript code in the body of your component is a good practice.

05:03.010 --> 05:09.850
But here I think it's also OK to put it into the template and show that this is possible to which is

05:09.910 --> 05:11.320
Ciechanow in place.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.450
Let's see if it works as expected.

05:14.450 --> 05:21.060
If I click this button the next item should have a blue background and it does.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.000
So that's working but pretty hard to read right.

05:25.030 --> 05:32.380
So let's finish the second part here and give it a wide color for this and my C S S file I will define

05:32.380 --> 05:40.270
a wide text class name any name you like of course that's totally up to you and I will set the color

05:40.300 --> 05:41.490
to white.

05:41.490 --> 05:48.680
Now does white text see us as class should only be attached if we are at element 5 or higher.

05:49.060 --> 05:55.960
So next to Engy style I will also add Engy class and I will use property binding so square brackets

05:56.110 --> 06:02.380
here too because I need to pass a javascript object to the energy class property on the energy class

06:02.380 --> 06:08.440
directive to have it work correctly because this directive needs to know which classes should be attached

06:08.440 --> 06:11.820
when well between single quotation marks.

06:12.070 --> 06:20.530
Since we have a dash inside the name I'll add the white text KLOS the Clasby just created here only

06:21.070 --> 06:24.110
if the current conditions specified here as a value.

06:24.190 --> 06:25.330
Returns true.

06:25.690 --> 06:29.690
And the condition simply is log item greater or equal than 5.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.550
Just like on the end style directive.

06:32.980 --> 06:38.740
So if this returns true we should have the white text clause attached which should turn the text white.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.200
Let's see if it works.

06:40.450 --> 06:42.130
Ugly display details so.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.440
Here the text clearly clearly is not white.

06:44.470 --> 06:48.430
That is working and now looks good.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.870
Blue background white text.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.990
Awesome.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.080
Now I will show a nice bonus to the solution in the next lecture actually where I will use time stamps

06:59.440 --> 07:02.790
because it uses an extra addition of energy for it.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.270
We haven't seen before.
