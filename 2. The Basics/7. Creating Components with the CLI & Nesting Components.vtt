In the last lectures, we learned a lot including the creation of a new component by hand.

00:08.940 --> 00:15.300
Now there also is an alternative to creating it manually. When using the CLI, you can open a new terminal

00:15.300 --> 00:18.470
window or command line, leave the ng serve window running,

00:18.470 --> 00:20.470
that's important, don't close it

00:20.490 --> 00:26.440
and in this new window we can use some CLI command to also create a new component.

00:26.640 --> 00:34.110
Let's say we want to have our single server components here in another component, so nested into

00:34.110 --> 00:40.320
another component, a servers, multiple servers component.

00:40.380 --> 00:46.500
We can create this manually by adding a servers folder with our component or we use the CLI with

00:46.590 --> 00:54.780
ng and there we have a generate command, which allows us to generate some elements, some elements

00:54.780 --> 00:56.790
supported by Angular.

00:56.940 --> 01:03.420
One such element is a component, so we can create a new component with ng generate component and

01:03.420 --> 01:07.830
then passing the name, servers like this.

01:07.830 --> 01:15.990
You can also use a shortcut and instead of ng generate component, you could say ng g c which does

01:15.990 --> 01:17.580
the same.

01:17.580 --> 01:23.940
So if you hit enter, what this will do is it will give you a new folder in your app folder with the name

01:23.940 --> 01:25.780
of your component, servers

01:26.130 --> 01:33.060
and in there, you basically find the same files as you had for the app component, HTML, CSS, TS and this

01:33.120 --> 01:37.160
spec file which basically is used for testing.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.670
Now I will remove this,

01:38.670 --> 01:45.120
we will later have a section about the testing and we'll have a look at the styling later too,

01:45.150 --> 01:52.770
for now let's say it is in this servers component that we want to output our single server.

01:53.040 --> 01:58.110
Well we already have this selector, app server,

01:58.380 --> 02:05.580
so in this template of the servers component, we can overwrite the default text with app server and maybe

02:05.580 --> 02:11.250
simply replicate this so that we have two components because remember, components are reusable.

02:11.250 --> 02:17.610
We can use the same component as often as we want by simply using its selector as often as we want.

02:17.920 --> 02:25.500
So now we have two servers here and with this in our servers component, you need to make sure that you

02:25.500 --> 02:27.770
also update the app module.

02:27.780 --> 02:33.510
Now the CLI should do this automatically which is why you already find the import and the declaration

02:33.510 --> 02:34.480
in this file

02:34.650 --> 02:37.460
but make sure you really do have it here.

02:38.010 --> 02:44.610
With this, we can go to our servers.component.ts file to check the selector which is app-servers

02:44.730 --> 02:52.080
and then we can go to our app.component.html file and update the selector to use

02:52.080 --> 02:55.310
this new component instead of the old one.

02:55.410 --> 03:01.290
With this if we now save this and go back to our application, it looks almost the same as before, we see

03:01.290 --> 03:03.910
our single server component twice

03:04.200 --> 03:11.430
but if we inspect the code here in the developer tools of Chrome for example, you'll see that we have

03:11.430 --> 03:16.050
this outer app servers component, this newly created component

03:16.200 --> 03:20.720
and in between, we have two single app server components.

03:20.730 --> 03:25.710
So with that, we learned a couple of important things about how to create components manually or with

03:25.740 --> 03:32.160
the CLI, how we can nest them into each other, that we can use components selectors in any other template

03:32.160 --> 03:39.110
of any other component and how we can replicate components by simply using them

03:39.150 --> 03:42.530
multiple times, using their selectors multiple times.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.940
Let's dive into how we can actually style them, what we can do regarding the style and the template

03:47.940 --> 03:48.740
of components.
