00:02.620 --> 00:05.770
We're almost done with the basics about Angular,

00:05.770 --> 00:12.350
we learned a lot about components, the basic building block of any Angular app, about how it starts the

00:12.360 --> 00:19.900
app, how we can communicate with our templates in our components so that we can output data or react

00:19.900 --> 00:21.100
to events,

00:21.100 --> 00:28.050
now there is one other key building block you probably use in any Angular app you build, directives.

00:28.300 --> 00:33.910
What are directives? Directives are instructions in the DOM

00:33.970 --> 00:37.350
and we actually already use directives without knowing it,

00:37.390 --> 00:44.950
components are kind of such instructions in the DOM. Once we place the selector of our component somewhere

00:44.950 --> 00:46.480
in our templates,

00:46.480 --> 00:53.830
at this point of time we're instructing Angular to add the content of our component template and the

00:53.830 --> 00:58.650
business logic in our TypeScript code in this place where we use the selector.

00:58.660 --> 01:00.930
This was our instruction, Angular

01:00.940 --> 01:08.050
please add our component in this place and indeed components are directives but directives with a template,

01:08.560 --> 01:12.190
there are also directives without a template.

01:12.280 --> 01:19.090
So an example would be the appTurnGreen directive which would be a custom directive we could build.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.960
We typically add directives with an attributes selector

01:24.970 --> 01:30.280
but technically the selector of a directive can be configured just like the selector of a component,

01:30.280 --> 01:33.920
so you could also use CSS classes or the elements style

01:33.940 --> 01:37.390
but again typically use the attribute style

01:37.660 --> 01:44.320
and on this paragraph, this directive might simply color the text green you could say. So Angular would

01:44.320 --> 01:52.720
find this instruction, here we would have defined our directive with the directive decorator to inform

01:52.720 --> 01:55.070
Angular that this class holds a directive

01:55.270 --> 01:58.440
and there, we might have the logic to turn this green.

01:58.810 --> 02:05.440
Now we will learn how to write our own directives in the section focused on directives in this course

02:05.920 --> 02:10.290
but there are a couple of built-in directives which are really useful.

02:10.430 --> 02:15.120
Let's take a closer look at how we use them and what they do for us in the next lectures.
