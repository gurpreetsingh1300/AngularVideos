00:02.500 --> 00:06.690
So where are you successful Let's have a look at my solution to gabber.

00:06.820 --> 00:12.830
The first task was to create two new components one manually and to Selye maybe.

00:12.850 --> 00:16.240
So I will start with the first one which I'll trade manually.

00:16.300 --> 00:23.260
I will create a new folder and I will name a warning alert and then there I will create a new file which

00:23.260 --> 00:26.900
will name warning all word dodge component dot.

00:27.430 --> 00:30.400
Following this naming convention I explained.

00:30.910 --> 00:38.570
Now in this typescript file I will export a class which will also name warning alert component.

00:38.590 --> 00:45.940
Again following this convention of being descriptive about what's in it here I will add the component

00:46.210 --> 00:52.090
decorator and as you learned the component decorator needs to be imported.

00:52.180 --> 00:58.250
So we should import component from at angular core like this.

00:59.970 --> 01:05.220
With that import added We need to configure the component so that angular is able to do something with

01:05.220 --> 01:05.810
it.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.840
We absolutely need to add a template and we should also add a selector here so that we are able to use

01:12.840 --> 01:13.530
it.

01:13.650 --> 01:20.520
Now the selectors could simply be app warning alert again to have a unique selector and the template

01:20.550 --> 01:25.680
you could point to a external file or use an inline template for days component.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.830
I will use the inline template though of course you are free to choose the external file and I will

01:31.830 --> 01:39.300
simply but when takes your create a multi-line string when I have a paragraph in which I say this is

01:39.660 --> 01:40.860
a warning.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.600
You are in danger.

01:42.600 --> 01:47.530
Whatever text you like is as my first component for now.

01:47.550 --> 01:50.610
Now I will treat the second component with the Seelye.

01:50.820 --> 01:57.050
So in the terminal I can create a new one by running Engy generate component.

01:57.180 --> 02:03.880
Or as I told you to shortcut Gizzi and all this will be the success alert.

02:03.930 --> 02:06.140
So success alert will be the name.

02:06.150 --> 02:10.910
This will give me success alert folder with all these files.

02:10.980 --> 02:19.510
I don't need the spec for the testing file here so I will remove it and now in this folder here we get

02:19.890 --> 02:22.660
out of the box working types typescript file.

02:22.770 --> 02:28.290
We get a HDMI file as a side note you can ignore this constructor and energy on that thing.

02:28.290 --> 02:38.170
I will come back to this later and here I want to output a number message where I say you are so successful.

02:38.180 --> 02:41.260
Maybe this is my success message.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.090
So with that both components are true you need it.

02:44.100 --> 02:48.770
I also already added their templates to the content of the templates.

02:48.780 --> 02:54.010
Now we should output them beneath each other here in the AB component.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.840
So do it is right below this paragraph.

02:56.840 --> 03:06.500
Maybe add a horizontal line to separate them and then I'll add the app warning alert component and the

03:06.730 --> 03:07.250
app.

03:07.340 --> 03:10.070
Success alert component.

03:10.350 --> 03:14.190
And now if we save this we will get an error.

03:14.220 --> 03:17.650
So now is your chance to anticipate this error and fix it.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.760
But it will show you which error it is in a second.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.520
So I'll save this.

03:22.730 --> 03:28.670
And let's now go to our presumably working application where we.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.820
Oh guess what.

03:29.820 --> 03:30.930
Find an error.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.010
So what's wrong.

03:33.090 --> 03:34.760
Let's have a look at the error message.

03:35.190 --> 03:39.150
Most major error messages are a kind of useful and ular that's a good thing.

03:39.300 --> 03:44.130
And here it says that app warning alert is not a known element.

03:44.190 --> 03:49.200
Isn't that strange because warning alert does select for here.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.960
I can copy it out and I don't have a typo.

03:52.230 --> 03:58.200
If I now paste it in there doesn't look like it had one so it should be known.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.950
Nope forgot one important thing app module.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.430
We have to add it there.

04:03.720 --> 04:10.630
Success alert component was add automatically since we used to Selye but our warning alert component.

04:10.770 --> 04:17.670
Well we have to add it on our own so we should add a warning alert component here and I could use my

04:17.670 --> 04:21.020
ID to auto imported bad for this time.

04:21.030 --> 04:29.640
I will type the import manually so warning Oler component should be imported from.

04:29.640 --> 04:36.020
And now we should point to our warning alert folder and there two warning alert Dotts component file

04:36.030 --> 04:44.370
without datt TSA dnt now with this in place now if you go back to the application now we see this as

04:44.370 --> 04:44.960
a warning.

04:44.970 --> 04:47.910
You are a danger or you are so successful.

04:47.910 --> 04:50.260
And now we can see both components.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.500
So we've finished these tasks here.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.950
Now let's solve them appropriately.

04:56.130 --> 05:02.150
So maybe a little box with a red background for the warning and with green for the success case.

05:02.160 --> 05:07.530
So for the warning alert I'm again going to use inline styles to have everything in line here to show

05:07.530 --> 05:08.700
how this works.

05:08.700 --> 05:16.850
So at my styles irate and in there I'll add back text to be able to write a multi line style and I basically

05:16.850 --> 05:20.690
want to style my paragraph which is the only element I have in here.

05:20.750 --> 05:30.380
So this paragraph now should receive some padding maybe 20 pixels and a background color of let's search

05:30.380 --> 05:39.210
for red or maybe some misty rose or something like that it's like red tagged shoes any color you want

05:39.710 --> 05:45.090
and maybe also let's give it a border of one pixel solid and a solid red color.

05:45.290 --> 05:52.340
If eyes save us we should now see books like a warning alert box looks fine to me.

05:52.370 --> 05:56.010
Now let's copy this for our success box.

05:56.090 --> 06:01.620
But here I'm going to use the external file which is already referenced in the typescript fall here.

06:01.820 --> 06:10.050
So let's add it here let's turn this to some light green maybe green yellow or do we have something

06:10.070 --> 06:15.340
pale green maybe and then use a clear green here for the border.

06:15.350 --> 06:20.420
And now we should see two boxes below it Shavar and one green one red.

06:20.510 --> 06:24.340
Depending on the component with our own style at it.

06:24.350 --> 06:30.530
So with that all tasks are completed this was the first little assignment to play a round of components

06:30.770 --> 06:36.150
and get into how to create how to style and how to work with them.

06:36.440 --> 06:40.760
Let's dive deeper into the basics of angular in the next lectures.
