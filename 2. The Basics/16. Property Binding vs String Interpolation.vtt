00:02.890 --> 00:05.720
In the last lecture, we learned about property binding,

00:05.770 --> 00:12.400
now if we had the use case that we also want to output the current value of allowNewServer, we

00:12.400 --> 00:17.890
could of course use string interpolation to simply output allowNewServer and a boolean can also

00:17.890 --> 00:19.660
be cast into a string.

00:20.110 --> 00:25.500
So now we see false here and after two seconds, you see this changed to true because we change it in the code.

00:25.660 --> 00:26.980
Nice.

00:26.980 --> 00:32.320
Now this is one of the cases here where you can easily use property binding instead of string

00:32.320 --> 00:33.410
interpolation.

00:33.580 --> 00:43.560
So you could simply bind to a property of this element, the innerText property and set this equal to

00:43.560 --> 00:45.210
allowNewServer.

00:45.210 --> 00:50.940
Now I can remove the string interpolation here inside of the text and whilst it might look empty now,

00:51.030 --> 00:56.520
well we set in our text so we get the same behavior as before because the innerText property of an

00:56.520 --> 01:00.000
element is just what's between the opening and closing tag,

01:00.000 --> 01:05.990
so in this case, we were able to easily replace string interpolation with property binding.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.630
So when should you use which of the two?

01:08.910 --> 01:14.880
Well basically if you want to output something in your template, print some text to it, use string interpolation,

01:15.330 --> 01:21.990
if you want to change some property, be that of a HTML element or as you will later learn, of

01:21.990 --> 01:23.560
a directive or a component,

01:23.730 --> 01:25.740
typically use property binding,

01:25.740 --> 01:31.080
that is how you can differentiate it and you will get a feeling for this once you work your way through

01:31.080 --> 01:33.280
the course project and so on.

01:33.510 --> 01:41.680
So this is this, one important note I want to make is don't mix property binding and string interpolation.

01:41.850 --> 01:48.750
You might notice that here, we have disabled equals and then we have quotation marks and then directly,

01:48.830 --> 01:55.410
our property name. There are no curly braces between these quotation marks and there shouldn't

01:55.410 --> 01:55.830
be

01:55.950 --> 01:57.430
because that will break the app,

01:57.450 --> 02:02.050
this will not work. Between the quotation marks of property binding,

02:02.130 --> 02:09.270
you can and you must already write TypeScript code so to say, a TypeScript expression which will return

02:09.270 --> 02:11.100
the value this property expects,

02:11.100 --> 02:14.360
so for disabled some expression which returns true or false.

02:14.400 --> 02:20.580
So just like with string interpolation, you may also call a method there but you must not add curly braces

02:20.580 --> 02:21.540
in there.

02:21.630 --> 02:25.110
Whilst it might look we simply use a HTML attribute

02:25.140 --> 02:26.420
there. We aren't,

02:26.490 --> 02:30.650
this whole syntax here is a syntax recognized by Angular,

02:30.780 --> 02:37.360
so this is why between the quotation marks, you can already and you have already, you have to write TypeScript

02:37.370 --> 02:43.770
code because again, this whole expression is evaluated by Angular, mixing in string interpolation will

02:43.800 --> 02:44.540
break it,

02:44.580 --> 02:51.750
string interpolation only works in a normal template, not within another expression of that template,

02:51.870 --> 02:55.770
not within a property binding or something like this.

02:55.950 --> 03:03.090
With that, enough about property binding and generally about outputting data in the template, let's see

03:03.240 --> 03:05.730
how we can react to events.
