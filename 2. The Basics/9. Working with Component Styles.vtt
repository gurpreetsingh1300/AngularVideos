00:02.500 --> 00:08.560
We understood that templates are important and that we can either use them inline here or point to

00:08.560 --> 00:10.150
an external file,

00:10.360 --> 00:11.700
what about styles?

00:11.710 --> 00:17.230
We also have this styleUrls property here and we have these CSS files.

00:17.230 --> 00:19.080
What can we do with those?

00:19.550 --> 00:22.070
Let's go back to our app component for this.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.710
Here we got a h3 tag and a horizontal line

00:25.810 --> 00:30.120
and if we have a look at our application, it's not that pretty, right?

00:30.330 --> 00:37.060
The I'm in the app component text here or all the text actually is sitting right on the edge here, not

00:37.060 --> 00:38.640
super pretty.

00:38.830 --> 00:45.610
Now since we use bootstrap, of course we can use some bootstrap classes to enhance this. So we could add

00:45.640 --> 00:49.800
a div with a container class around it, then add a row

00:49.900 --> 00:53.490
and this is just using the CSS framework, bootstrap,

00:53.500 --> 00:58.400
so these are some CSS classes provided by this framework, nothing Angular specific

00:58.660 --> 01:05.080
and then we could add a column here, xs-12 to have one column on all device widths.

01:05.080 --> 01:12.100
Now if we add this, we added some styling, some normal CSS styling, nothing Angular specific

01:12.100 --> 01:15.400
and our app looks a little bit nicer now.

01:15.490 --> 01:21.360
This is great but we can also use some tools given to us by Angular.

01:21.430 --> 01:24.990
Let's say this, I'm in the app component heading here,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.390
we want to change that style,

01:27.590 --> 01:31.960
maybe we want to give this some blue color.

01:32.290 --> 01:39.480
We can do it just by going to the app.component.css file which defines the styling for this component

01:39.880 --> 01:42.690
and now we can use or write normal CSS code,

01:42.700 --> 01:49.570
so overwrite the style of the h3 tag and set its color to some blue,

01:49.570 --> 01:52.970
so maybe to this dark blue here.

01:53.230 --> 01:59.050
If we now save this and we have a look at our application, you see it's dark blue

01:59.060 --> 02:08.230
now. This is how you can use this style file, this CSS file referenced in the app component here to

02:08.240 --> 02:11.390
define the styles for a component.

02:11.500 --> 02:20.170
Now just like we were able to choose between external file and inline code for template, we can do

02:20.170 --> 02:22.420
the same for the styling.

02:22.600 --> 02:29.310
You notice that styleUrls is an array here whereas templateUrl wasn't. It is this

02:29.350 --> 02:36.290
because we could reference multiple external stylesheets here, so you could add pointers to other stylesheets

02:36.790 --> 02:40.370
but besides that, I'm going to comment this out,

02:40.420 --> 02:44.170
you can also set up another property which is just styles.

02:44.200 --> 02:50.770
This also takes an array but now it takes an array of strings where you define the style in this string,

02:50.770 --> 02:57.400
so now in this file. Here I'm going to use back ticks again to be able to write a multi-line expression

02:57.400 --> 03:00.790
here and then we could set up h3 here

03:00.790 --> 03:05.430
and to really show you that this is different, I will set the color to 

03:05.440 --> 03:10.390
now let's not say dark blue but to dodger blue.

03:10.750 --> 03:18.070
And if I now save this and we go back to the application, you see the blue updated because now the inline

03:18.070 --> 03:19.470
style is taking over,

03:19.480 --> 03:25.460
I commented out the other one. Just like with the template, you have to decide which one to use,

03:25.460 --> 03:32.290
you can't combine styleUrls and styles but both important here has to be an array, that's the difference

03:32.290 --> 03:33.000
to template,

03:33.020 --> 03:40.730
you must only have one template, you may have multiple style files or style definitions and you can choose

03:40.730 --> 03:43.330
between inline and external file.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.370
The rules are basically the same as for the template.

03:46.370 --> 03:52.970
If you have more code in there, using an external file is a good idea, if it's a short style definition

03:52.970 --> 03:53.670
like this,

03:53.720 --> 03:56.970
why don't you just put it into the TypeScript file?

03:56.990 --> 03:59.940
This is how you can work with templates and styles.
