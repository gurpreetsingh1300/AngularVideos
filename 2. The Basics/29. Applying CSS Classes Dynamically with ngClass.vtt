00:02.790 --> 00:10.850
We saw examples for ngStyle and ngIf, now something related to ngStyle is ngClass.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.930
Now we learn that ngStyle allows us to dynamically assign a style,

00:15.970 --> 00:23.500
now I will also add ngClass here and where ngStyle allowed us to change the CSS style itself,

00:23.830 --> 00:28.430
ngClass allows us to dynamically add or remove CSS classes.

00:28.870 --> 00:31.660
So let's create such a class and for this, I will

00:31.810 --> 00:34.390
first of all add my styles here

00:35.630 --> 00:42.170
and I will use back ticks to write this over multiple lines and I will give this a class name of online, in

00:42.170 --> 00:48.950
which case I want to color the text white. So that's all I want to do because I think it's kind of hard

00:48.950 --> 00:52.400
to read the black text on the green background.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.310
So back here, ngClass also,

00:55.330 --> 01:00.250
this is the directive, also only works as intended when using property binding.

01:00.350 --> 01:03.090
So let's wrap it in square brackets too

01:03.440 --> 01:09.230
and here we also need to pass a Javascript object and that's just the case for this property of this

01:09.320 --> 01:09.980
directive here,

01:09.980 --> 01:16.300
of course each property you bind to may take a different value, like disabled which took true or false.

01:16.430 --> 01:21.450
So here it's a Javascript object and for ngClass object works like this.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.570
We also have key-value pairs,

01:23.750 --> 01:30.980
the keys are the CSS class names and the values are the conditions determining whether this class should

01:30.980 --> 01:33.200
be attached or not.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.390
So here, we have the online class,

01:35.390 --> 01:37.750
you could also wrap this in single quotation marks

01:37.850 --> 01:41.690
if you had a class name with a dash inside of it or something like this

01:42.020 --> 01:42.950
and here,

01:43.310 --> 01:44.750
well I want to attach this

01:44.780 --> 01:54.220
only if the server is online, so only if serverStatus equals online, online

01:54.220 --> 01:57.200
here is a string between single quotation marks.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.420
Now of course you could also outsource this in a method, you call this serverStatus equal online check

02:02.420 --> 02:04.610
but here I will write it inline.

02:04.970 --> 02:10.600
So if this is online, we should attach the CSS class online to this paragraph

02:10.670 --> 02:12.880
otherwise this should not get attached.

02:12.890 --> 02:15.030
Let's view this in the running application,

02:15.080 --> 02:21.690
both are offline so none of the two should have the online CSS class added to it

02:21.830 --> 02:26.250
and indeed, I can't find the class on any of the two.

02:26.270 --> 02:30.770
Now let's reload and hope that some of them is offline or online, excuse me, both are

02:30.830 --> 02:32.180
so let's check it,

02:32.180 --> 02:35.180
now we see the online class has been added,

02:36.030 --> 02:40.400
actually to both of them because this is how ngClass works.

02:40.470 --> 02:44.680
It only adds like CSS class if a certain condition is true

02:44.850 --> 02:51.230
and that's an example for another built-in directive, another built-in attribute directive.
