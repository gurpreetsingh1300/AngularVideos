00:02.440 --> 00:07.980
In the last lecture, we had a look at the basic ngIf syntax and that's the syntax you're going to use

00:07.980 --> 00:11.670
most of the time, there is one alternative to it though.

00:11.850 --> 00:16.910
Sometimes you have not only the if condition but also an else condition,

00:17.160 --> 00:23.640
so here we might want to say server was created, server name is something with ngIf but we could also

00:23.640 --> 00:27.820
add an else block where we then want to say no server was created.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.690
Now we deleted that exact text for the reason that we don't want to see it

00:31.830 --> 00:34.730
but imagine that we do want to show that alternative,

00:34.740 --> 00:42.300
so no server was created could be the text here and now we want to show this paragraph only if ngIf is

00:42.360 --> 00:46.230
not true or this condition, server created, is not true.

00:46.620 --> 00:54.900
We can achieve this by placing a local reference on this element here and local reference is something

00:54.930 --> 01:00.580
I will dive deeper into in the understanding components and data binding section of this course.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.960
For now let's think of it as a marker,

01:03.150 --> 01:06.120
so I will name this noserver,

01:06.120 --> 01:07.900
any name you like,

01:08.000 --> 01:08.500
noServer

01:08.520 --> 01:10.580
with a capital s

01:10.710 --> 01:19.230
and now we need to change the paragraph here to ng-template. That is a component, that directive shipping

01:19.260 --> 01:24.350
with Angular which you can use to mark places in the DOM

01:24.660 --> 01:30.190
and now I will add the paragraph back in this template with the text in between, like this.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.750
So now basically the text we want to output

01:32.820 --> 01:39.330
and now with ng-template, with that local reference, this marker on it, we mark a certain spot in the template

01:39.390 --> 01:42.540
which we want to show conditionally.

01:42.540 --> 01:50.330
Now to show it conditionally, we simply enhance ngIf by also adding else and then noServer,

01:50.370 --> 01:57.810
so this marker we placed on ng-template and that's all the syntax we need. If we save this, you see no

01:57.810 --> 01:59.280
server was created

01:59.280 --> 02:02.820
and as soon as I click here, that gets replaced with server was created.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.210
So that is ngIf else, a nice little addition in a use case where you have

02:08.280 --> 02:10.050
an else condition.

02:10.200 --> 02:15.860
Of course the alternative would always be to simply use ngIf with the reversed check,

02:15.900 --> 02:18.480
so with !server created

02:18.690 --> 02:21.810
but that here is another nice alternative.

02:21.810 --> 02:23.830
Now I'm going to delete it,

02:23.850 --> 02:29.160
you will find an article after the section here though where you can find this code again

02:29.160 --> 02:34.940
in case you are interested and we'll also use this code in the course project we're going to build.

02:35.190 --> 02:39.510
I just wanted to highlight that this option exists, using ngIf like

02:39.510 --> 02:42.570
this however is the case you will see most of.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.590
Now let's continue.
