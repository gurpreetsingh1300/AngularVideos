So now that we get started with this course and with Angular and our project we're going to use in this course,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.840
it's time to dive deeper into Angular to understand what really does, what happens behind the scenes,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.710
how an Angular gets started in the first place and which base building blocks it offers us, how we can

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.520
build Angular apps and which features we may use for this.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.400
By the end of this section, you will understand how you can build your basic Angular application, what

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.690
it then does and what you need to change to reach a different result.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.920
So with this, let's dive into it and let's start by having a look, what actually happens when we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.230
visit

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.090
this page in the browser when we reload this page, how does Angular get started,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.760
what do we actually see here, besides nothing

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.710
because there is more to this page than it might look like.
