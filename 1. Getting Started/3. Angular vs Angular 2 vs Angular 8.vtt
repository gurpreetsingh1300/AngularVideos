00:02.280 --> 00:08.680
This course is about the latest version of angular which at the moment is angular 8.

00:08.690 --> 00:10.670
Now that sounds like you missed a lot.

00:10.670 --> 00:17.330
If you're just starting with it the good thing is you didn't because Angela worsening sounds more complex

00:17.330 --> 00:18.500
than it is.

00:18.620 --> 00:26.060
You could argue that thus far they're actually only where two major big words of angular the first one

00:26.060 --> 00:35.030
was angular J.S. also referred to as angular one that was released years ago and worked totally different

00:35.150 --> 00:40.760
than the angular you're going to learn at this course and you shouldn't use it for new projects anymore.

00:40.790 --> 00:46.820
Instead the angler team worked on a completely new version which is simply referred to as just angular

00:46.850 --> 00:52.550
so without angular J.S. which was initially released as angular two and sometimes on the internet you

00:52.550 --> 00:59.260
still just find content on angular 2 and that typically also means that it's about angular angular 8

00:59.260 --> 01:03.050
7 and so on in general but more on these observations in a second.

01:03.080 --> 01:10.310
So angular 2 was released in 2016 and it was a complete rewrite of angler J.S. It works totally different

01:10.430 --> 01:16.130
has a lot of different concepts and there are basically no similarities between these two frameworks

01:16.460 --> 01:22.820
so you don't need to know angular jazz to learn angular in which everywhere if you know angular jazz

01:23.060 --> 01:27.770
it won't be a problem but it unfortunately also won't help you much.

01:27.770 --> 01:31.010
Okay so that's angular too but discourse is about angular 8.

01:31.010 --> 01:37.010
So what happened in between there was angular for free was skipped for internal reasons.

01:37.010 --> 01:39.270
So the next version was angler 4.

01:39.560 --> 01:45.690
And then there were a couple of our worshipers five six seven and now we have angular eight.

01:45.860 --> 01:53.270
The reason for this variety of versions is simply that the angular team releases a new major word as

01:53.270 --> 02:01.190
they call it every six months roughly and they do that not to change everything with every release.

02:01.190 --> 02:07.550
Instead all the code you are learning here basically would still work in angular too with very few exceptions

02:08.120 --> 02:12.500
all the code you do learn here of course works with angular 8 because I do constantly keep this course

02:12.560 --> 02:18.050
up to date with the latest version but there haven't been many changes between angular 2 and 8.

02:18.230 --> 02:22.310
So these new numbers can be a bit confusing at first.

02:22.340 --> 02:28.820
The angular team is simply having this jewel of releasing a new bigger whereas in every six months where

02:28.820 --> 02:35.600
they have the option of introducing some bigger changes but they rarely do this and if they introduce

02:35.690 --> 02:41.180
bigger breaking changes they always do that in a backward compatible way so that what you will learn

02:41.180 --> 02:45.050
now will also still be relevant in a year or two.

02:45.050 --> 02:50.790
That simply explains angular 8 and that simply is why we have that many versions.

02:50.930 --> 02:54.830
The major shift was from angular J.S. to angular though.
