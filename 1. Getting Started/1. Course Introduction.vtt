Welcome to my complete guide on angler it's so great to have you on board in this course.

00:07.620 --> 00:13.860
You're going to learn what angler is and how you can use it to build awesome front end web applications

00:13.860 --> 00:14.310
with it.

00:14.400 --> 00:21.390
Very reactive web applications with great user experiences for that throughout this course.

00:21.390 --> 00:26.940
You're going to learn all the individual building blocks which make up angular before we then also dive

00:26.940 --> 00:29.480
into these more advanced features.

00:29.580 --> 00:34.880
And we're going to build a project throughout the course putting all these things you'll learn in theory

00:34.890 --> 00:40.650
kind of in which you practice throughout the course into the perspective of a real project so that you

00:40.650 --> 00:42.800
can see how you would apply them there.

00:42.900 --> 00:48.670
And that as you can see how you build up a real web applications with the things you learn here.

00:48.690 --> 00:53.780
So with that I'd say let's dive into it and let's dive into the most important question first.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.260
What is angular.
